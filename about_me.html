        <h1 class="display-4" style="font-size: 5rem;">Hi! I'm Thomas.</h1>

        <p style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> My Name is Thomas, and I was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia. I spent most of my life there, up until 2014; I’ve been back and forth between Korea since then. I originally went to (Dalhousie) university thinking I was going to be a doctor, but ended up studying psychology. My fascination with people and social interactions drew me to psychology, and its still what drives my career and hobbies.</p>

        <h1 class="display-4" style="font-size: 5rem;">Teaching</h1>

        <p style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> I’m currently employed as an English teacher in South Korea. I work teaching kindergarten, elementary, and adult students. I enjoy the variety of levels as it keeps me on my toes, and I get to try out a lot of different teaching techniques. That being said, teaching adults is my favorite! I love teaching grammar and conversational English to adults; They are self-motivated and we are able to have a lot of great, interesting discussions. I come to think of students as more like friends than students; It makes the atmosphere a lot more relaxed, and the learning becomes a lot more flexible and natural. In the future I hope to be able to help more adults learn English through classes or one on one tutoring. <a href="coming_Soon.html">To see my English lessons click here.</a></p> 

        <h1 class="display-4" style="font-size: 5rem;">Photography</h1>

        <p style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> My passion for photography, and portrait photography in particular, grew after meeting a Korean photographer. I did a little modeling for them; I used to be so nervous in front of the camera and thought I always looked bad. BUT! They were able to get some nice photos of me, which really boosted my confidence. It was weird to see a model like picture of me. So, I want to be able to do that for other people too. I believe everyone should have photos of themselves that make them feel empowered, and good about themselves. I hope to be able to take photos like that for a great many people! <a href="coming_Soon.html">To see my photos click here.</a></p>
